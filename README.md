> Web application allowing users to easily store and access cooking recipes.

> The app is designed to keep your recipes in one place as if it was an old cookbook; easy to add, update, delete and search for recipes.

> Recipes can be sorted by countries of origin, cost and whether they are vegetarian or not.

> Each recipe can than be displayed in details on one page with the full list of ingredients, their quantities and the steps to follow for making it. The options of modifying or deleting the recipe are given also on that page.

> An extra page allows the users to add their own recipes to the app with all the options available.
